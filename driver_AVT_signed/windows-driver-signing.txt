I use a own CA to get rid of issues with unsigned drivers under Windows. To use these(self) signed drivers,
the root and intermediate CA certificates must be imported to computer certificate store.

Following commands must be run with elevated command prompt, to add certificates to computer instead of user.
	certutil.exe -enterprise -addstore Root rootcert-AVTroot.cer
	certutil.exe -enterprise -addstore CA intercert-AVTadmin.cer

After this, the signing certificate "Marc Hefter - codesign" is accepted as valid.

some additional notes:
*	certutil is part of Windows (%windir%\System32)
*	makecat,signtool (The needed tools for signing) are part of Windows SDK
*	After creating/signing the catalog file, the inf MUST NOT be modified, or signature gets invalid
*	if adding the certificates with "certificate import assistant" (by double clicking in explorer), choose
	local machine as store location instead of current user.
